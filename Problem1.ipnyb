Question 1: Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: click here to access the required data set

On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 

Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 
From my understanding of statistics, the data of AOVs is slightly skewed (higher than what it must be) due to the presence of outliners like 70400. This happens as one user spends a lot in the month of march as seen from the data. We need to use a method resistent to outliners like median or interquartile range (IQR) as mean is highly affected b the extreme values.
What metric would you report for this dataset?
Median or IQR
What is its value?
Median - 284

Question 2: For this question youâ€™ll need to use SQL. Follow this link to access the data set required for the challenge. Please use queries to answer the following questions. Paste your queries along with your final numerical answers below.

How many orders were shipped by Speedy Express in total?
SELECT COUNT(Orders.OrderID) as 'OrderCount' 
FROM Orders JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID=Shippers.ShipperID 
WHERE Shippers.ShipperName = 'Speedy Express';

So, we get 54.

What is the last name of the employee with the most orders?

SELECT Employees.LastName 
FROM Orders JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID=Employees.EmployeeID 
GROUP BY Employees.LastName 
ORDER BY Count(Orders.OrderID) DESC
LIMIT 1;

Output: Peacock

What product was ordered the most by customers in Germany?
SELECT Products.ProductName, SUM(OrderDetails.Quantity) AS Quantity 
FROM Orders JOIN OrderDetails ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderId 
JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID 
JOIN Products ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID 
WHERE Customers.Country = "Germany" 
GROUP BY OrderDetails.ProductID 
ORDER BY Quantity DESC 
LIMIT 1;

I considered the most ordered product quantitatively. 
This gives Boston Crab Meat as the most ordered product by customers in Germany with the total quantity of 160.
